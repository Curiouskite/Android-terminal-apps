Issues solve in android terminal 
1.) You can't run execute in /storage/emulated/0/ anywhere because it mounted like that

Solution : don't try to execute bash scripts just use  " sh (filename) " 

Android contain no bash only mksh which is very basic

If you are writing terminal app how do you set $HOME VARIABLE.   $OTHER VARIABLES

Use text file  ( inside -> HOME=/data/data/your-app).  Now load it with terminal command ( source filename) 
Source command run any file in current terminal session so it sets home and other parameter


Demo c program

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	
system("source libs/hi && cd /data/data/com.op && sh ");
	
}
